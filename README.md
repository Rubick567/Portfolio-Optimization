# Portfolio-Optimization
A Python program which will help a user select a portfolio of NASDAQstocks, by computing an efficient frontier. 

## Overview
In this project, I got some practice integrating our toolkit, using R, MySQL, Gurobi, Python, Excel, and (possibly, for prototyping) Solver. 
In stead of producing the list of stocks since I assumed investing in all the stocks in Nasdaq, I just established a general model of selecting the stocks developed a graph of maximized returns for several different levels of risk (variance) so far.

## Attached Files
The analysis is based on the file, NasdaqReturns.csv consisting of average monthly returns for many different NASDAQ stocks over several years. My deliverables includes:
* portfolio.py - Your Python program as described in the next section.
* calc_corr.R - Your R program to populate the covariance or correlation matrix. 
* nasdaq.sql - Your final database dump (export).
* writeup.Rmd - The R Notebook used to generate your write up.
* writeup.PDF - A PDF knitted from your R notebook consisting of your grap

## Solver
Before I started optimizing the real stock data in Nasdaq, I planned to create a prototype solving a simplified problem in Excel solver(This has been proven a pretty efficient and intuitive way of solving more complicated problems). I solved the simple
portfolio maximization problem of Section 8.1 (in "Practical Management Science Six Edition") using Solver. I made sure I
got the same answer both in Excel solver and in Gurobi. This model validation step is key to solving this project efficiently (it will save much troubleshooting if I run into errors later), and is even more critical when model building
in my further career.

## MySQL
The following is the part of quries I used to create a database to support my R and Python programs, which I can also do using MySQL WorkBench.
```
create database nasdaq;
use nasdaq;
create table cov (
stock1 varchar(10),
stock2 varchar(10),
covariance double
);
create table r (
stock varchar(10),
meanReturn double
);
create table portfolio (
expReturn double,
expRisk double
);
```
## R
* First, I calculated a correlation or covariance matrix, Q. I also calculated
a vector consisting of the mean return of each stock, r. I stored these in two
separate tables.
variances to compute the portfolio variance. Since I had already calculated the covariance matrix cov(), I didn't need to calculate a correlation matrix cor().
* Using the database functionality in the R Package RMySQL (and possibly the melt function in the reshape2 package), I connected to MySQL database, and populated your r
and cov tables, and any other tables I saw as appropriate.
* The trick here is that when generating many insert statements, there was considerable overhead with each and every dbSendQuery call. I was able to optimized this process by reducing this step by half by
uploading just the upper or lower triangular matrix, and then reconstructing the remaining values on demand in Python, since the matrix is symmetric. 

## Python
* Since I already had a prototype model created by gurobi, the rest of the work is to modify the model and make it fits the real-world data set.
* One advantage here is that I didnâ€™t have to reconstruct the Q matrix in my code since I just read the melted version created in R and had written it to my database.
* Once the gurobi optimization model worked, I could plug a range of return targets(with the lower bound being the minimum return within the minimum risk rate and the upper bound being the highest expected return among the basket of stocks) and get the related expected risk rate through the objective function.
